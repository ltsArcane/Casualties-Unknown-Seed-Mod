# Forenote
Ay, thanks for showing interest in helping with contributions!

Uno problemo: <b>Mild chance of me just outright not dealing with any contributions or issues submitted.</b> As mentioned in the README, the mod is kinda sorta already done, and doesn't need much else. I'll do some slight changes here and there every so now and then, and maybe run patches for newer releases, but that's about it.

But yeah. Re-iterating: I'm not much of a game developer / modder, so rules will be pretty lax. Just make sure it somewhat follows the general style set by yours truly based on the source code, I guess?

# Submitting Changes:
1. Fork the repository and create a new branch (`git checkout -b abc/xyz`).
3. Commit your changes with ✨descriptive✨ messages.
4. Push your changes, then submit a pull request.

# Reporting Issues and Questions?
<p align="center"> <i>PLLEEAASSEE</i> include a detailed description <br><b>---> !!! and steps to reproduce !!! <---</b><br> </p>
Things like dealing with Issues isn't really in my forte, but if that's how you'd prefer to bring up the problem, then there you go.<br>
I'd much rather prefer reports via Discord DMs (ltsarcane), pinging me in Orsoniks' studio (preferably #cas-unknown, just don't mention modding directly), etcetera, so we can chat and deal with the problem in real time.<br>
